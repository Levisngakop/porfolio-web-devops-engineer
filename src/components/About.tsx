  </h3>
  <p className="text-slate-300 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I design, automate, and maintain scalable cloud-native infrastructure on AWS and Kubernetes. 
    With over 5 years of experience, I’ve built production-grade environments, CI/CD pipelines, 
    and systems that improve deployment speed, reliability, and operational efficiency.
  </p>

  <p className="text-slate-300 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    My approach combines technical precision with a focus on people — ensuring systems not only work reliably 
    but also enable teams to move faster, reduce friction, and adopt best practices seamlessly.
  </p>

  <p className="text-slate-300 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I actively mentor engineers, guide teams through complex deployments, and introduce automation 
    and observability practices that strengthen operational excellence.
  </p>

  <p className="text-slate-300 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I am always looking to take on challenging projects that require building resilient, scalable systems, 
    optimizing workflows, and empowering teams to achieve more.
